Welcome to my mini class routine project.In this project, I have designed and organized the complete class routines for 1st to 8th semesters according to the academic structure of Patuakhali Science and Technology University (PSTU). This project was developed as part of my HTML fundamentals practice, with a particular focus on mastering HTML tables, including proper structure, alignment, and presentation of tabular data.
